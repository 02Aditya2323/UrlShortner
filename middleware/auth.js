// JWT in Cookies vs. JSON for Mobile Browsers
// Cookies work in all browsers (desktop and mobile), but there are some caveats:
// Mobile browsers do support cookies, but if youâ€™re building a mobile app (not a browser), cookies are not as straightforward.
// For mobile web apps (in the browser), cookies work, but you must set the SameSite and Secure flags properly for cross-site requests.
// For native mobile apps (iOS/Android), you typically store the JWT in secure storage (not cookies).
// Solution:
// For web (desktop/mobile): Use HttpOnly cookies for best security.
// For native mobile apps: Send JWT in JSON, store it in secure storage (e.g., Keychain for iOS, Keystore for Android), and send it in the Authorization header for each request.
